WORKING NOTES
========================================
DONE be able to load a text file and display it (just ascii for now)
	start: 11:30pm 10/4
	end: 11:50pm
DONE display with a proper font and with decent spacing 
	progress (11:57): it works, but looks like ass
	12:20: looking into SDFs
	1:27: got SDFs working, took way too long because of a dumb typo
DONE be able to scroll through the file.
DONE don't allow scrolling past the end of the file

DONE convert buffer to a line system
	start: 9:45 end: 10:30

DONE wrapping around an arbitrary length and scrolling that lets you be on part of a wrapped line
	sub: line numbers
	sub: float viewpos

DONE cursor that follows view (and view follows it)
	sub: buffer_pos, convert to draw pos, draw rect storing (chars and lines)
	sub: switch to view rect and only render what's needed

DONE have view and cursor movement work nicely together
	sub: change the system to make it more reliable (int rects) and easier to work with (easy view->bufferpos conversion)




INFO
========================================
A text editor

Mission-critical
--------------------
Read/write text files
Insert strings
Have multiple windows (split screen)
Modal: like my modal scheme in 4coder (but better hopefully)
Select & copy/cut & paste

*shudder*
Syntax highlighting
Auto-indenting, preferably automatic like 4coder
// Look into tree-sitter
//IMPORTANT: if we can integrate tree-sitter, we probably get free parsing for basically anything

LS: c/c++ (probably no advanced stuff)


Less important
--------------------
Have a nice system for switching between buffers, unlike every other text editor (no just entering the name)
// Like maybe show a preview?
Nice highlighting for file (and buffer?) lists
Block select
Multi-line editing (like block select/insert in vim)
Macro recording/replaying

LS: html, css, js, python, bash

*shudder*
Terminal integration, mainly for building. A pop-up build window like 4coder
Better error display, jump-to-line, and showing errors at the line they occur on


Watchlist-warranting
--------------------
Interactive chatbot w/ face that helps with stuff (integrate cheat.sh?) and shows emotions. Cute mascot?!?
It could have its own buffer and a little pop-up interface?
Could be displayed with ascii art, as that would go well with the text editor vibe

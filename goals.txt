WORKING NOTES
========================================
DONE be able to load a text file and display it (just ascii for now)
	start: 11:30pm 10/4
	end: 11:50pm
DONE display with a proper font and with decent spacing 
	progress (11:57): it works, but looks like ass
	12:20: looking into SDFs
	1:27: got SDFs working, took way too long because of a dumb typo
DONE be able to scroll through the file.
DONE don't allow scrolling past the end of the file

DONE convert buffer to a line system
	start: 9:45 end: 10:30

DONE wrapping around an arbitrary length and scrolling that lets you be on part of a wrapped line
	sub: line numbers
	sub: float viewpos

DONE cursor that follows view (and view follows it)
	sub: buffer_pos, convert to draw pos, draw rect storing (chars and lines)
	sub: switch to view rect and only render what's needed

DONE have view and cursor movement work nicely together
	sub: change the system to make it more reliable (int rects) and easier to work with (easy view->bufferpos conversion)

DONE SMOOTH CURSOR MOVEMENT!!!!

DONE better cursor movement with keys
DONE smooth view movement

DONE simple editing with cursor
DONE Current goal: move up and down in wrapped lines

DONE investigate char entering free bug
DONE more chars, backspace, del, enter

DONE basic changeable colors
DONE: Mouse click move cursor

DONE Unicode (UTF-32)
DONE get Print working again
DONE fix mouse clicking (1/2 off both axes)
DONE(hopefully) Solidify text rect and char rect concepts

DONE Views & Multiple buffers
                DONE sub: separate buffer into purely text/file data, move spatial data into view struct

DONE (yippee! :smug:) rect spawn system :shiver:

DONE Basic Modal system
DONE Adjust view based on cursor when typing and when scrolling
DONE Listers and commands
DONE better path handling
DONE touch up edit file lister

Current Goal: Selection

Undoing and redoing

Fix: not rendering partially visible chars

Clean up some, c++-ify lists, count->length

Add ctrl-backspace to lister and buffer

File writing

Better border seek :cry:

Colorscheme (comes after/with treesitter)

TREE SITTERRRR

INFO
========================================
A text editor

Mission-critical
--------------------
Read/write text files
Insert strings
Have multiple windows (split screen)
Modal: like my modal scheme in 4coder (but better hopefully)
Select & copy/cut & paste

*shudder*
Syntax highlighting
Auto-indenting, preferably automatic like 4coder
// Look into tree-sitter
//IMPORTANT: if we can integrate tree-sitter, we probably get free parsing for basically anything

LS: c/c++ (probably no advanced stuff)


Less important
--------------------
Unicode
Have a nice system for switching between buffers, unlike every other text editor (no just entering the name)
// Like maybe show a preview?
Nice highlighting for file (and buffer?) lists
Block select
Multi-line editing (like block select/insert in vim)
Macro recording/replaying

LS: html, css, js, python, bash

*shudder*
Terminal integration, mainly for building. A pop-up build window like 4coder
Better error display, jump-to-line, and showing errors at the line they occur on


Watchlist-warranting
--------------------
Interactive chatbot w/ face that helps with stuff (integrate cheat.sh?) and shows emotions. Cute mascot?!?
It could have its own buffer and a little pop-up interface?
Could be displayed with ascii art, as that would go well with the text editor vibe
Look into integrating cheat.sh
OpenCYC seems like a bust BUT we can get free WolframAlpha API calls so look into integrating that
